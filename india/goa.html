<h1>Culture of Goa</h1>
<h2>Carnival</h2><br>

<img src="images/goa1.jpg" width="480" height="300">
<p>Perhaps the most famous of all festivals, the Carnival is the epitome of celebrations in Goa. It is celebrated for three days and three nights and preceded by the month of Lent (February), this festival brings alive every nook and corner of Goa. Introduced by the Portuguese colonial rule in the 18th century, this festival is that time of the year when the legendary King Momo takes over the operations of the festivals and events.

Though introduced by the Portuguese, the Carnival is a part of ancient Rome and Greece which later crept into the culture of Spain and Portugal. Initially, the Carnival had a touch of Portuguese style to it, but with time and India's independence, the festival began to be celebrated in full Goanese style.

Goa Carnival, the most fun-filled festival in Goa,  is meant to be a feast of food, drinks, music, dance and fun - before the 40 day period of fasting and absenteeism of meat in the month of Lent. The days are marked by colourful and musical parades which initiate in the capital Panaji and travel throughout the state making it one of the most popular festivals of Goa. The evenings are kept for gala balls, and people engage in partying on the streets all through the night. The float parade in Panaji is led by King Momo, who floats a specially decorated float to declare the initiation of eating, drinking and partying.

Though the Carnival was on a decline in the past few years, yet the efforts of Goa Tourism Department and the state government have ensured that not only is the festival revived but also contributes to attracting tourists for the state. The Carnival just cannot be missed.</p>

<h2>Feast of Saint Francis Xavier</h2><br>


<img src="images/goa4.jpg" width="470" height="300">
<p>This renowned festival in Goa is carried out to honour the death of Saint Xavier, popularly known as 'Goencho Saib' (Lord of Goa) by locals. He was a tremendous Catholic missionary born in 1507 and came to India with the Portuguese Viceroy of Goa in 1543. His primary task was to preach the religion of Christianity and the Gospel of Jesus to the people of Goa, Spice Islands, Japan and China among other Asian countries. He died on 2nd December 1552, in the Sancian island, about 10 kilometres from the mainland of China.

As per popular legend, a group of Portuguese merchants performed his last rites and buried him in a coffin partly filled with unslaked lime. After few months, a Jesuit (member of the Society of Jesus) exhumed the body and was astonished to see that the corpse had not at all decomposed. It was further surprised when he cut a finger from the body and saw blood oozing out. Upon this discovery, Francis Xavier was conferred with the title of 'saint'.

The mortal remains of the saint were placed in a silver casket in the Church of Bom Jesus (Basilica de Bom Jesus). However, one hand was cut off from the body- pieces of which were distributed to various parts of the world under the supervision of the Pope. Until 1994, Saint Xavier's body would be brought out every ten years on the anniversary of his death. The corpse would be kept in a glass case with the feet exposed. People from all over India and world would visit the church to worship and catch a glimpse of the saint. After 1994, the body has not been brought for public display since the condition of the corpse had deteriorated significantly.

This religious festival of Goa is celebrated for nine days, starting on 3rd or 4th December. During the celebrations, hundreds of devotees from all over the state, the country as well as the world flock Goa to offer their prayers to St. Francis. Huge arrangements of food and drinks are made available to the public, and the park outside the church turns into a picnic spot, with everyone socialising and engaging in various fun activities. Church services begin as early as 4:00 AM and people mark their presence to honour this legendary soul.</p>

<h2>Three Kings Feast</h2><br>


<img src="images/goa5.jpg" width="450" height="300">
<p>One of the most popular festivals of Goa is the Three Kings Feast. Organized and enjoyed by Christians and non-Christians alike, this festival is celebrated in the village of Verem in North Goa and Cansaulim, Chandor in South Goa. This feast is dedicated to The Lady of Mount- Virgin Mother Mary with infant Jesus in her lap, who is believed to be the protector of people and is worshipped as the Goddess of fertility. The celebrations take place for nine days and are held in the century-old chapel of Nossa Senhora dos Remidos or Our Lady of Cures.

As per legend, a boulder on a nearby hill has two sets of footprint engraved- one of an adult and one of an infant. Also, a depression on a big rock is believed to be the spot where Mother Mary took some rest while the horse on which they travelled drank water. Later, they proceeded to the Hill of Remedies where they resided. Some historians also believe that the chapel where the festival takes place was once a site of a Hindu temple. Hence, this explains the active involvement of Hindus who seek Her blessings and offer their prayers.

The festival is celebrated with a lot of enthusiasm and energy, organised by the Vangodds of the Gauncars (indigenous Goans). The idol of Virgin Mother Mary is decorated with flowers, gold jewellery, candles, garlands, incense sticks. The isolated hill on which the chapel is situated finds its significance for this one event throughout the year. A large number of people climb up the steep hill to recite the Rosary for the lady of the blue mantle and attend the mass music dance party are carried out for nine days till the events concluded on January 6 in the Epiphany.

The last day of the festival is perhaps the most important. Three boys aged between 8 to 12 from the three villages are chosen to represent The Three Kings. They ride on horsebacks - each on a separate, traditional path called Paz and meet at some distance away from the chapel of our lady of remedies on top of the hill at Cuelim. The boys are dressed as proper royalty in king's robe with jewellery, crowns and gifts of gold frankincense and myrrh. The kings together offer prayer to the lady of the mount and attend a High Mass at 12:00 PM on the hilltop, which is accompanied by sounds of choirs and footsteps in succession. A little boy beating a kettle drum lead the kings who are followed by happy crowd. The Three Kings then place the gifts infant of the Statue of baby Jesus.</p>

<h2>Shigmo</h2><br>


<img src="images/goa10.jpeg" width="450" height="300">
<p>Shigmo or Shishirotsava is a significant festival of the Hindu community in the state of Goa. Sigmo is a Konkani word derived from the Prakrit word Suggimaho and the Sanskrit word Sugrishmaka. This is a spring festival celebrated around March every year. However, since the dates are connected to the Hindu lunar calendar, its dates vary according to the Gregorian calendar. This festival has two variations: Dhakto Shigmo and Vhadlo Shigmo. Dhakto or small Shigmo concerns the farmers the labour class and rural people. Vhado or big Shigmo is celebrated on a much larger scale by people of every class and profession.

Welcoming the season of spring, this festival was initiated to honour the homecoming of warriors who left their homes and families to fight the invaders. It is said that a spirit, known as the Gade padap enter the dancers on the final day of the festival. The conclusion is marked by a collective bath taken, known as the Mand davarap.
The Shigmo festival of Goa is in every essence a Hindu version of a carnival and is a variation of the Holi festival. The celebrations see a mesmerising side of Goa like no other. The entire state is drenched in a sea of colours and parties on a massive scale. Shigmo typically displays folk dances, street plays and magnificently built floats that depict scenes from the local and Hindu mythology. People play a vast number of musical instrument like flutes, dhols, drums, trumpets, etc. Both music and folk dances form a part of the grand parade which begins at Ponda and proceeds to other places of Goa in the next few days.  

The celebrations are held for a fortnight, with each day dedicated to a different area. People place money in a plate carried by the performers, and in response, the performers sing a song - Tali to wish the wellbeing of the donor. The enactment of various mythological scenes and a variety of folk dances are an essential highlight of the festival. Every year thousands of tourists, as well as locals, come to be a part of this awe-striking amalgamation of plays, music, dance and lights.</p>

The festival has a really fascinating story and the story is such that in 1896 when people began dying due to an epidemic that broke out in Vasco, the local turned to an avatar of Shiva, Lord Damodar for help. A sacred coconut, which was installed at Vasco as a divine symbol to be worshipped, was brought from the famous Damodar Temple at Zambaulim (22km from Margao).

The epidemic abated as their devotion bore fruit. The residence of a leading citizen was donated to install an idol of Lord Damodar. Even now, this small temple attached to the original house is the main venue during the celebration.

Many years ago, the villagers resisted against the Portuguese rule of demarcating areas by putting up flags, to mark areas that could not be taken up by people of nearby villages. The inhabitants had protested by knocking down all the flags. Since then, this festival began to be celebrated as a tribute to those protests and protestors.

Every small community or group of people celebrate this festival in Goa by creating colourful tableaux and embarking on massive parades throughout. Extensive feasting takes place and almost every household is decorated, thus presenting a scenic atmosphere. A very interesting activity during this festival is the mock fights that take place between rival groups, thus resembling the knocking down of flags.
