<h1>Culture of Kerala</h1>
<h2>Onam</h2><br>

<p>Onam (also known as Thiruvonam) is the state festival of Kerala, observed by all its citizens, irrespective of caste, creed or community. It is a harvest festival celebrated once a year during the Malayalam month of Chingom (August-September). Onam is traditionally celebrated with much joy and fervour.<br><br>

Some of the celebrations include creating a Pookalam (an extravagant arrangement of colourful flowers), visiting temples, feasting on an elaborate meal served on plantain leaves, gifting others with new clothes, participating in boat races held on the backwaters, a variety of sporting events and even Pulikkali (a tiger dance).</p>

<h2>Vishu</h2><br>

<p>Vishu is an auspicious festival celebrated by Hindus on the first day of the Malayalum month of Medam (April-May). Vishu is hailed as the beginning of a new year by residents of Kerala. The most significant ritual observed during Vishu is the Kani Kanal (meaning ‘first sight’), as it is believed that the fortunes of the upcoming year depend on what object is seen first on the morning of Vishu.<br><br>

Another practice is Vishu Kaineettam, where money is gifted to the younger members of each family. The entire family joins in for a mid day feast (Sadya) and then ends the day’s celebration with a dazzling display of fireworks. Arattu at Thiruvananthapuram<br><br>

<p>The Aranmula Uthrittathi is celebrated with a ritual boat race held during the Onam festival. Legend has it that a boat carrying offerings to the Aranmula Parthasarathy Temple was under attacked by enemies. People from the neighboring areas sent their snake boats to protect it. This has now evolved into a snake boat race, presented as an offering to Lord Parthasarathy.</p>
