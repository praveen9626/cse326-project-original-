<p>2020 Date: 25 July<br><br>
An important festival in Maharashtra, Nag Panchali is celebrated in the honour of the Snake God Shesha Nag on the fifth day of the holy month of Shravan. Snake worship is an important ritual in India, and on this festival, cobras made of clay are venerated in homes. It is mainly celebrated for two reasons. Firstly, the abode of the nags (snakes) forms the bottom of the patal lok, and the blessings of the nags are sought for the well-being of the family. Secondly, the nags (snakes) keep the crops safe from rats and rodents, and so the farmers pray to the nag-devta and offer their thanks. People make offerings of sweets and milk to the snake deity. Cobras are carried by snake charmers in baskets and they collect offerings from the public in the streets. The day is celebrated with dances and songs in the streets. People throng nag temples and also Shiva temples since the nag is very closely associated with Lord Shiva.</p>
